# Summer 2019 Web Design at RISD — Assignment 1

* **Do not edit this file.**  
* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**

## Instructions
This assignment is designed to get you to understand how to combine content and markup semantically. There is not any CSS, and thus, no design aspect to this project.

Create a single web page using the content under the **Headings** section as the starter content, along with some images from the web. **Include all your HTML in the file `index.html`. Images, discussed below, must be placed in the `img` folder.**

## Before You Begin
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`.
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub user handle.

You’re now ready to start working. **Note**: This is the submission protocol for all four projects. Thus, make sure you understand it.

## Page Title
Add content you feel is appropriate to the `title` element.

## Headings
Use the outlining algorithm to mark up each of the following items, sans em dashes:

— **Susan Kare**  
— **Artists**  
— **Salvador Dalí**  
— **Engineers**  
— **Matthew Carter**  
— **Bookstore**  
— **Typography**  
— **Frida Kahlo**  
— **Linus Torvalds**  
— **Designers**  
— **Art**  
— **David Carson**  
— **Engineering**  
— **Tim Berners-Lee**  
— **Typographers**  
— **Jean-Michel Basquiat**  
— **Neville Brody**  
— **Design**  
— **Jan Tschichold**  
— **Håkon Wium Lie**

## Quoting
Search online for quotes about — or by — four people listed above. You must provide a source for each quote. Place this content where you feel is most semantic. See MDN’s [blockqoute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) entry for ideas.

## Images
Once you’ve marked up the content under the **Headings** section, [search Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/) for images of *one* person per heading section. (You may only use images that are in the public domain or that are governed by a Creative Commons license.) Employ these in your project — either link directly to external URLs (for example, `<img src="http://www.site.com/image.jpg" alt="">`) or place your images in the `img` folder (for example, `<img src="img/image.jpg" alt="">`).

Pay attention to image ratios, as these will inform your design. If need be, alter the images so they respect ratios you’ve chosen. See MDN’s [img](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) for more.

## Validate
Make sure Atom continually reports `No errors were found!` in the lower left hand corner as you work. Solve validation issues as you work — don’t let them accumulate. That’s called technical debt. Avoid it!

## Due
1:00 PM on Wednesday, 24 July 2019.

## Submission
You will need to issue a pull request back into the original repo, the one from which your fork was created. See the **Issuing Pull Requests** section of [this site](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/index.html) for help on how to submit your assignment.

**Note**: This assignment may *only* be submitted via GitHub. **No other form of submission will be accepted**.
